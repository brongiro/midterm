      Officials began inspecting the damage of Notre Dame Tuesday. They declared
      the cathedral structurally sound while identifying “some vulnerabilities,”
      according to French Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez. Specifically,
      the vault and gable of the north transept were of concern. Inspectors are also worried about structural damage that may be hidden.

      Kirk Martini, a professor at the University of Virginia School of
      Architecture with a doctorate from the University of California at
      Berkeley in structural engineering, said the transept is probably the
      greatest vulnerability. To ensure the structure is stable, additional
      shoring may be necessary after the full extent of the damage is assessed.

      Limestone is a key building element of the structure, and stone is
      susceptible to damage from heat and water. “There may have been some
      damage to the stone, even the places that currently appear to be intact ... because of the weaknesses of the material,” Martini said. “That’s a
      big unknown.... I don’t think anybody knows the extent of that damage.”

    <p>
      French President Emmanuel Macron hopes the country can rebuild Notre Dame
      within five years. With the scale of the project, Martini is skeptical
      that timeline will be met, even with the number of resources being
      promised for restoration. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/04/16/yesterday-notre-dame-burned-today-people-around-world-raised-millions-rebuild">Hundreds of millions of dollars</a> have already
      been pledged for the rebuilding efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the cathedral will be restored is also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/notre-dame-fire-updates/2019/04/17/00dbbd84-6091-11e9-bf24-db4b9fb62aa2_story.html"> up for debate. </a> On Wednesday,
      Prime Minister Édouard Philippe announced an international competition to
      replace the iconic spire that collapsed into Monday’s blaze.

    <h2>A Look Into The Famous Cathedral</h2>

      Notre Dame is of geographic and cultural importance to Paris. It sits purposefully near the center of the city on a small island surrounded by the Seine River.
    </p>
    <blockquote>It is also the landmark next to which all other Parisian monuments are measured.</blockquote>

    <p>
      Martin Moeller, senior curator for the National Building Museum in
      Washington, said it is not coincidental that Notre Dame is one of the most famous Gothic churches. “The plaza in front of the cathedral was built specifically to give a good viewing point,” he said. “It's not an accident that so many people have taken photographs of the front of the church.”
    </p>
    <p>
      There is already a debate brewing about how the church should be restored.
      Whether the efforts will include building materials similar to destroyed
      in the fire or more modern materials will be up for more discussion once
      officials fully assess the damage, to the building and to its artifacts.

    <p>
      Much of the art and relics were saved from the flames. The cathedral’s
      large stained-glass windows appear to be undamaged, and there’s a strong
      case for restoring the famed structure as closely as possible to its
      former glory.

      Even the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-cathedral-notre-dame-de-paris/"> White House offered assistance </a> in the rehabilitation of the cathedral. While Notre Dame is revered around the world, Moeller stressed the importance of considering how other catastrophic fires of major landmarks are handled.
    </p>
    <p>
      In St. Landry Parish, La., three black churches burned down from arson
      within 10 days in late March and early April. Before Monday, a GoFundMe
      for the churches had raised just below $50,000 in rebuilding aid. After a
      Twitter campaign urged people to remember the Louisiana churches amidst
      the devastation of Notre Dame, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/04/17/after-notre-dame-fire-gofundme-ensured-black-churches-burned-louisiana-got-million-too/"> total skyrocketed to $1 million by
      Wednesday.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      “Obviously it's one of most famous buildings in the world,” Moeller said
      of Notre Dame. “But we want to make sure that people remember that there
      are other buildings that are important to other communities. It may not be
      as famous, but when tragedy strikes there it can be devastating to a particular community or a particular group of people, and sometimes it
      doesn't get the attention it deserves.”
